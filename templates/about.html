        <!-- Problem Statement -->

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Choosing a career path is a critical decision for students, often influenced by a complex interplay of personal, academic, and financial factors. Many students lack access to personalized guidance that considers their unique profiles, including academic performance, personality traits, interests, and financial constraints. Traditional career counseling methods may not scale effectively or leverage data-driven insights, leading to suboptimal career choices that do not align with individual strengths or market demands.

        <!-- Solution -->

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>
                The Career Navigator is a web-based application that uses machine learning to provide personalized career recommendations. By collecting data on users' age, education level, academic scores, personality traits, study habits, extracurricular activities, hobbies, interests, budget, and career demand preferences, the system predicts suitable career paths. The model, trained on a comprehensive dataset, employs a Random Forest Classifier to ensure robust predictions. The user-friendly interface allows students to input their details through an interactive form, receiving tailored career suggestions that align with their profiles and aspirations.

            <h2>Architecture Diagram</h2>
            <p>
                The Career Navigator follows a client-server architecture. The frontend, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, uses Bootstrap for responsive design and Flask's Jinja2 templating for dynamic content. The backend, powered by Flask, handles form submissions, preprocesses data using StandardScaler, and makes predictions with a pre-trained Random Forest model. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset and serialized using joblib for efficient loading. The diagram below illustrates the data flow from user input to career prediction.

            <h2>Dataset Source and Features</h2>
            <p>
                The Career Navigator uses a combined dataset, <code>icn_dataset.csv</code>, which integrates data collected from multiple sources, including student surveys, publicly available datasets from Kaggle, and synthetically generated data. The final dataset contains 30,000 records simulating student profiles and their corresponding career outcomes. The features, listed below, capture a wide range of attributes to ensure accurate career predictions. Before training the Random Forest model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing using <code>StandardScaler</code> to normalize numerical features.
